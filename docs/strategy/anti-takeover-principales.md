# Anti-Takeover Principles

Royal Mix Global is built to resist hostile or premature acquisition.

## 1. Founder Control

- Strategic decisions remain with the founder
- No early dilution
- No full equity disclosure at test stage

## 2. Access Control

Partners access:
- Outputs
- Results
- Reports

They never access:
- Core logic
- Agent system internals
- Platform architecture

## 3. Negotiation Rule

Any acquisition discussion is valid only when:
- The system operates in multiple regions
- Data proves dominance
- Alternatives exist

## 4. Core Principle

If someone wants to buy Royal Mix Global,
it means the system already won.
