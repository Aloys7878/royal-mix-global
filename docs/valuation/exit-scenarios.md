# Exit Scenarios – Royal Mix Global

Exit is an option, not an objective.

## 1. Acquisition

Valid only when:
- The ecosystem is dominant
- The buyer cannot replicate it
- Founder terms are respected

## 2. Licensing Instead of Sale

Prefer:
- Country licenses
- Sector licenses
- Revenue sharing

This preserves control and multiplies value.

## 3. When NOT to Sell

- During test phase
- Before data maturity
- When buyer only wants product IP

## 4. Founder Rule

No exit without strategic alignment.
Money alone is not enough.
