# STEP 7 – Execution & Growth Engine

Royal Mix Global enters the execution phase.
This step transforms vision into cash flow, agents into infrastructure,
and a platform into a national + global economic engine.

## Core Objectives
- Activate 1,000+ agents
- Generate real daily revenue
- Establish national presence
- Prepare global scale-out

## Growth Pillars
1. Agent Network (Street → Digital)
2. Platform (App + Web + Pi Ecosystem)
3. Institutions (Governments, NGOs, Companies)

## Why This Works
Most platforms rely only on software.
Royal Mix Global combines:
- Humans (agents)
- AI (automation & intelligence)
- Data (decision power)
- Institutions (legitimacy)

This makes Royal Mix Global extremely hard to disrupt.
