# Economic & Competitive Defense System

## Threats
- Big companies
- Governments pressure
- Copycats
- Buyout attempts

## Defense Layers
1. Speed (we move faster)
2. Data (we know more)
3. Agents (we are everywhere)
4. Ecosystem (hard to copy)
5. Community trust

## Strategy
Let others copy products.
They can’t copy system + data + people.
