# Architecture (summary)

- Mobile (Expo) calls backend (API Gateway)
- Critical uploads: client gets signature from /cloudinary/sign (Lambda) then uploads to Cloudinary
- Auth: JWT via Clerk / Supabase (future)
- Storage: Cloudinary for media, Supabase/Postgres for structured data
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions build & deploy (mobile via EAS, web via Vercel)
